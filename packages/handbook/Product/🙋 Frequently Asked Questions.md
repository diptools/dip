## Is this library intended to be used with Bevy games?

- [Original Github Discussion](https://github.com/diptools/dip/discussions/51)

>So the short answer is no unfortunately. You cannot overlay UI within the same window that renders game graphics. This is because dip depends on a different window manager calledÂ [TAO](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao). Which is actually the hard fork ofÂ [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)Â but totally different rendering logic.

>At least for now, this project is aiming for DOM based app developers that needs extra power and flexibility in their apps comparing to existing solution like Electron + React stack.
